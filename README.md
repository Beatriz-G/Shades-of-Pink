# Shades-of-Pink
Making a website on different shades of pink that I like. 

In the last years, I've fallen in love with the color pink. In general, pink was always a color I gravitated to, but recently, its been on my mind more. 

I decided to create this page to show different shades of pink. I'm always looking to incorporate pink in my work, and often find shades I love, but they don't always feel right for that project. I am creating this page to save those shades and hopefully it will help you find one that you like!

# Contributing
I'd love see what shades of pink you like! If you feel you have a shade you'd like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request! Share a shade of pink that I might not yet have, or that you think is really special!

When sharing, please give the rgb/rgba color value, hsl/hasla color value, full name or hexadecimal color number. Please also share why you like that color!
