<h1>Pink Shades by Beti</h1>

<h2>Hola, I love pink.ðŸ©·</h2> 

<p>I always find shades of pink that I like, and I don't always know what to use them for or where to save them. I decided to create this projkect so that I have a space devoted to Pink!
  I can easily access it when it working online and can grow my library of pink throughout the years!</p>

<h4>I am in the process of figuring out how to show the shade of pink, if you have any ideas, let me know!</h4>
